My first 50 3D models, sculpted in VR with the creative programs Oculus Medium and Masterpiece VR, are online on Sketchfab.
The models are funny animal balloons and are available for [free download](https://sketchfab.com/smeerws).
If you like them, it would be awesome to support me with a coffee on [__Buy me a coffee__](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/smeerws).
