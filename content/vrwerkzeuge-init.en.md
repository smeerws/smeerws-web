**Oculus Rift**: The Oculus Rift is a so-called Head-Mounted Display (HMD). The glasses were developed by Oculus VR and took over by Facebook in 2014. The glasses are characterized by a good price / performance ratio (about 500 euros).

**Computer**: In addition to the glasses you need a powerful computer. The minimum requirements for the Oculus or Vive are (as of 2017) a good graphics card, have at least one i5-4590 processor, be equipped with at least 8 GB RAM and have enough USB ports (costs > 1000 euros).
