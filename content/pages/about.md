Hello, my name is Susanne Meerwald-Stadler. I am on the way to transform my passion into a profession as a self-employed Extended Reality Developer for Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR) and Mixed Reality (MR). In recent years I have been involved in research focusing on Robotics and User Experience (UX). In search of new interface approaches for robots, I came into contact with AR for the first time. Since this time I am fascinated with virtual worlds of any kind. In addition to designing and developing such systems, I love painting, sketching and sculpting in this virtual world. My work materials consist of my computer, my VR glasses and the [corresponding VR program](./vr-tools.html).

In addition to painting in the virtual world, I have also rediscovered my desire for painting in the "real" world. I work with acrylic or mixed media on canvases. The [seminar](http://www.stift-reichersberg.at/veranstaltung/grossflaechige-experimentelle-malerei-h2023.html) "Large-scale experimental painting, in Stift Reichersberg acrylic and mixed media" held by [Renate Moran](http://www.renate-moran.at/) is one of my highlights every year.
