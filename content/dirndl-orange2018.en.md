I did it again. My second home-tailored Dirndl is finished :). Of course again with Helga the instructor in the VHS course "NÃ¤hen" in Strobl.
I have "disassembled" an already existing Dirndl in top and skirt. The existing top was adapted and re-piped "paspeliert". Afterwards, I made a new skirt and a new apron for the Dirndl. In addition, this time the skirt was pulled instead of laid.
